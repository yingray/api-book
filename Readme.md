**For Front-End Development, this library is easy to generate API fetch automatically by json ONLY!**

![api-book flow chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yingray/api-book/master/doc/apibook_flow_chart.png)

This library provide the useful featues to generate API fetch objects automatically by **json files(book)**, which back-end developer updated and maintained. Not only reduce communication costs of front-end and back-end, that need to synchronize information of RESTful API frequently, but increase program accuracy.

```js
// Easy to sync the APIs document from back-end using book!

const book = {
    getUserPicture: {
        url: '/api/user/{{userId}}/profile',
        method: 'GET',
        request: {
            header: {
                clientId: 'tsfhlkjswifqWERWERGvdsfaf'
            },
            path: {
                userId: 536251
            },
            query: {
                picId: 12345
            },
            body: {}
        },
        response: {
            type: 'json'
        }
    }
};
```

## Installation

```sh
npm install api-book
```

## Features

* Support all method to fetch API (GET, POST, OPTION etc)


## Quick Start

The quickest way to get started with Api-book as shown below:

Install the executable:

```sh
npm install --save-dev api-book
```

Create the desired API document(book):

```js
// book.js

const book = {
    getUserPicture: {
        url: '/api/user/{{userId}}/profile',
        method: 'GET',
        request: {
            path: {
                userId: 536251
            },
            query: {
            	picId: 12345
            },
            body: {}
        },
        response: {
            type: 'json'
        }
    }
};
```

Provide the appropriate host address:

```js
const host = "http://localhost:9000";
```

Provide optional API parameters:

```js
const init = {
    "headers": {
        "Accept": "application/json",
        "Content-type": "application/json;charset=UTF-8",
    },
    "credentials": "include"
};
```

Generate Api-book fetch and give appropriate parameters:

```js
import api from 'api-book';
export default api({ host, book, init });
```

In order to send the API, import the above output modules and call each other the desired API in the module:	

```js
import api from './book.js';

const request = {
    path: {
        userId: 536251
    },
    query: {
        picId: 12345
    }
};
	
api.getUserPicture(request)
    .then(response => {
        /*
            We build Reactions for calling APIs that works successfully
        */
    })
    .catch(error => {
        /*
            We build Reactions for calling APIs that works fails
        */
    })
	
```

Finally, that will generate the fetch object automatically to call API which link likes:

```
http://localhost:9000/api/user/536251/profile?picId=12345 (method: GET)
```

## Testing 

If you want to test the api that is working with server-side providing request data, change the option param while you generate Api-book fetch:

```js
export default api({ host, book, init, option: { testing: true } });
```

## Example

If you want to try this library easily, please follow the instructions below:

Install the executable:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yingray/api-book.git
cd api-book
```

Start the server:

```sh
npm start
```

Enter to `http://localhost:9000`, click the click button to inspect whether web page works successfully to request and catches the response. You can also refer to the files in the example folder of the package.

```
-- example              
	- index.html         (web page)
	- index.js           (main script to call API)
	- book.js            (access the api document)
	- bundle.js          (webpack bundle all scripts)
```
